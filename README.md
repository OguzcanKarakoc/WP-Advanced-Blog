# WP Advanced Blog Plugin

WP Advanced Blog is a wordpress plugin that aims to give webdevelopers more freedom to structure their blog. (more info will come when I've launched the first version)

## Roadmap

The roadmap will be updated when new suggestions are **being worked on**. If your suggestion is not on the list than it doesn't mean that I forgot about it, it simply means that I'm currently working on another item in the list. (Checked items will stay there for at least 1 week)
