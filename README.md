# WP Advanced Blog Plugin

WP Advanced Blog is a wordpress plugin that aims to give webdevelopers more freedom to structure their blog. (more info will come when I've launched the first version)

## Roadmap

The roadmap will be updated when new suggestions **being worked on**. If your suggestion is not on the list than it doesn't mean that I forgot about it, it simply means that I'm currently working on another item in the list. (Checked items will stay there for at least 1 week)

- [ ] Custom Regular expressions for shortcodes (this should make it possible to put a shortcode in a html tag)
- [ ] Nested shortcodes
- [ ] Add Post Type filter
- [ ] Allow
- [ ] Query all posts using all the filters
- [ ] Live pagination

## Installation

## Usage

Images and guides will be added when the plugin reaches version 1.0
